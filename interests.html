                Since I was 16 years old, I’ve loved using photography as a way to turn everyday moments into memories, and memories into beautiful, aesthetic representations of real life. I’ve been lucky enough to visit and get to know some amazing places and people throughout my life, and photography is one way in which I try to preserve these experiences. Photography connects me to my environment, my friends, and - more than anything - myself.

                Not only do I love trying new food, but I also love experimenting with recipes in my free time. Making something new is exciting - especially if it is from scratch! My experiences with food in the United States, as well as taking cooking classes in Spain, Italy, and Portugal, have given me insight in understanding different cultures and people.

                At Syracuse, I have a show once a week on WERW, a student-run radio station. It allows me to take a break from my school work and gives me an opportunity to incorporate music into my life. I am constantly exploring my own music taste and curating playlists to play on my show.            </div>

                Whatever it is, I am up for the challenge. I love going outside my comfort zone and trying things that I’ve never done before. Growing up as an only child forced me to come up with creative ways to entertain myself and that’s something I have carried with me throughout my life. I am always exploring my interests, trying a new hobby, and educating myself.
