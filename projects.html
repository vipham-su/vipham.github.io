                I re-designed and coded the home page and plan your visit page for the MOST museum in Syracuse, NY. The original website is outdated and does not fully capture the potential of the MOST museum. I wanted to encompass the brand of the museum while emphasizing the events and exhibits that they offered.

                <div class ="mostwireframeparagraph gothicfont">This museum is meant to entertain and educate kids. I wanted the front page to have a simplistic design for kids to understand while displaying the most important information for parents to view. For the home page, I thought about why a parent would be going on a museum website in the first place and what information they would want to find. While designing the website, I made sure it was kid-friendly with big pictures, geometric shapes, and colorful accents that complimented the MOST museum logo colors. </div>

            <div class="pythonparagraph gothicfont">Going to school in Syracuse, NY poses many challenges. One in particular is its infamous weather, where it can be sunny on Monday, then snow 13 inches on Wednesday. I wanted to create an application that would benefit not only myself, but other students going here as well. Since the weather varies so greatly, it is important to be informed on the daily weather and the best-suited clothes for it.
                <br>
                <br>
                I created this application using python to recommend clothing options based on your location. It prompts the user for their city first then outputs the current weather conditions for it. The user then enters their desired style for the day and it gives them an idea of what to wear. If the user is still unsure, it can go into further detail and output a list of specific clothing items from various brands depending on the article of clothing. I used a location API, weather API, and pandas dataframes.

            <div class="cleaneatsparagraph gothicfont">Clean Eats is a website inspired by my contemporary food issues class. The food system is directly linked to climate change and I believe it is our duty to help combat this as much as possible. Everyone needs to eat food, so it seems like a great place to start improving our individual environmental impact.</div>

        <div class="cleaneatsideation gothicfont">There’s a lot of misinformation and confusing food labels out there when grocery shopping. The average consumer will often buy food without knowing how the food is made or where it came from. My goal for Clean Eats is to have the website be a resource for all things food sustainability. It will feature information on different foods, how to be more sustainable, why being sustainable is important, what food is currently in season (based of user location), and where to find the nearest sustainable food markets.</div>

            <div class="gothicfont getinparagraph">One of the biggest problems I face at school is not having a car on campus. It has been difficult having to depend on my friends’ schedule for rides to grocery stores and other places. I am not the only student that has this problem - therefore, I came up with a college carpooling app for my professional writing class’ innovative idea competition. You can read my proposal more closely by clicking on it.

                <br>
                My project idea got voted for best idea by my classmates, and got chosen as one of the class-wide group projects. Three classmates were put in my group, and we have divided roles and responsibilities as needed to make the app as real as possible for our final presentation. I am the UX/UI designer and will be in charge of creating the whole look and feel of the app.
